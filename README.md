# flash-card-builder
A flashcard project for creating and using flashcards

This project was inspired by both the Seneca Learning platform as well as Quizlet. I created it with the intention of it being used by myself and classmates for revision and learning purposes. The project makes use of your web-browsers local storage to store the flashcards you create so make sure not to clear the cache of the page if you decide to use this as you will find your flashcards will have not been saved!

The project was my introduction to JS and before this, I had not written a single line of JS so the syntax was unfamiliar, however, I was already familiar with the programming concepts having written in python so this program's use of javascript is mainly calling functions.

As for the CSS, most of it is formatting the page elements however, I have also added media queries to correctly format the page on viewport resizing. I have also added keyframes for the animations of the buttons as well as animating the card flipping which was inspired by Quizlet

The HTML that was written was quite simple however it was also my introduction to HTML5 Semantic tags which provides information for screen readers and increased accessibility.




I hope you can use this program however you like maybe even build upon it if not, at least have fun using it.
